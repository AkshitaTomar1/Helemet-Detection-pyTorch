# 🪖 Helmet Detection using PyTorch

A deep learning project for detecting helmet usage using object detection techniques with **PyTorch**. This model is trained to identify whether individuals are wearing helmets in images — useful for traffic surveillance and safety monitoring in workplaces.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, PIL, Torchvision  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas  

## 💡 Features

- Object detection for helmet classification (helmet / no helmet)  
- Annotated image output with bounding boxes  
- Inference script to test on new images  
- Simple and modular codebase  



## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshitaTomar1/Helemet-Detection-pyTorch.git
cd Helemet-Detection-pyTorch
```

### 📦 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🧪 3. Run Inference

Make sure your `app.py` is set up to load the model and take an image path as input.

```bash
python app.py 
```

The script will display or save the output image with detection boxes and labels.
